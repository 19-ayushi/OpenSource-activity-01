First Contribution Project (Multi-Page)
Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is a multi-page personal portfolio website created specifically for beginners who want to make their first open-source contribution.

The goal is to fix existing issues, add small features, and improve the overall code quality across multiple pages. This project is a safe space to learn and practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in a more realistic project structure.

Project Structure
The website is now split into multiple files:

index.html: The home page.

pages/about.html: The about page.

pages/projects.html: A dedicated projects gallery.

pages/contact.html: A contact form page.

style.css: Contains all styles (with many issues!).

script.js: Contains all JavaScript logic (mostly empty).

ISSUES.md: This is where you start! It lists all the tasks.
