ðŸŸ¢ HTML: Content & Structure Issues
[ ] (All Pages): The <html> tag is missing the lang attribute.

[ ] (All Pages): Add a <meta name="description"> tag to the <head> of each page with unique content.

[ ] (All Pages): The navigation links are inconsistent. Some point to the wrong file paths. Make them all correct.

[ ] (All Pages): The main content of each page should be wrapped in a <main> element for semantic structure.

[ ] (All Pages): A shared copyright footer is missing. Add one to index.html, about.html, projects.html, and contact.html.

[ ] (index.html): Fix the typo in the main heading ("Portfolo").

[ ] (index.html): The page title in the <head> is generic. Change it to "Jane Doe - Home".

[ ] (about.html): Refactor the "My Skills" section from using <br> tags to a proper unordered list <ul>.

[ ] (about.html): The page title is generic. Change it to "About Me".

[ ] (projects.html): Refactor each project div to use semantic <figure> and <figcaption> tags instead.

[ ] (projects.html): The page title is generic. Change it to "My Projects".

[ ] (contact.html): The form is missing <label> tags for its inputs. Associate labels with inputs using the for attribute.

[ ] (contact.html): The email input incorrectly uses type="text". It should be type="email".

[ ] (contact.html): The form inputs are missing name attributes, which are necessary for submission.

[ ] (contact.html): The <textarea> should have a required attribute.

ðŸ”µ CSS: Styling & Layout Issues
